# HOW TO INSTALL 

Go to your Tera Directory which should either be 

STEAM:  C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Tera

STANDALONE:  C:\Users\Public\Games\En Masse Entertainment\TERA

Now go to \Client\S1Game and create a folder called _CookedPC (you can theoretically name it _mods too)

Move the file there and done!

:exclamation:People have mentiones that this does NOT work for them, if so go to;

TERA\Client\S1Game\CookedPC\Art_Data\Packages

and create a folder called _S1UI
